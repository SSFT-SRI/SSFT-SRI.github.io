Techniques based on formal logic, such as model checking, satisfiability, static analysis, and
automated theorem proving, are finding a broad range of applications in modeling, analysis,
verification, and synthesis. This school, the fifteenth in the series, focuses on the principles
and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of
this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in
studying and using formal techniques in their research.  A prior background in formal methods is
helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time
experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during the laboratory
sessions.  The main lectures run from Monday May 25 to Fri May 29.  They are preceded by a
background course "Speaking Logic" on May 23/24.
	<!-- The summer school will be
	     immediately followed by a two-day Bootcamp to reinforce some of the
	     skills acquired during the school.  Participants in the Bootcamp
	     will employ formal tools and techniques (including those taught in
	     this and prior summer school editions) under the supervision of the
	     Bootcamp faculty to create verified artifacts. -->

	  <b>Abstract</b>: Quantum computers have the potential to transform drug discovery,
	  materials design, energy production, and beyond. Recent breakthroughs in
	  physical implementations have brought this technology closer to reality.
	  In this course, we will learn about the problem of compiling quantum programs to
	  run on quantum processors. Even though state-of-the-art quantum computers are still
	  experimental and small in scale, the compilation problem is critical for
	  understanding the resources required for running different applications on
	  different emerging hardware and architectures. The course begins with a brief
	  introduction to quantum computing fundamentals and then transitions to discussing
	  two key phases of quantum compilation: (1) circuit optimization and (2) mapping and routing.

	  <b>Abstract</b>: The Tamarin prover is a state-of-the-art tool for cryptographic protocol analysis.
	  Protocols are specified using multiset rewriting, and a subset of first order logic is used to
	  specify protocol properties.  Tamarin then supports the automated analysis of protocols with respect
	  to their specified properties.  Tamarin enjoys a large user community and it has been successfully
	  used to analyze numerous industry protocols and standards, leading either to the discovery of subtle
	  attacks or automated proofs.

	  <b>Abstract</b>:
	  These lectures provide a practical introduction to specifying, verifying, and validating
	  algorithms using the Prototype Verification System (PVS), an interactive environment for system
	  specification and verification. PVS features a strongly typed specification language based on
	  Higher-Order Logic, with a type system that supports predicate sub-types, dependent types, inductive
	  data types, parametric types, prenex polymorphism, and built-in types and data-structures such as
	  numbers, booleans, strings, records, unions, tuples, arrays, sequences, sets, and lists. The PVS
	  theorem prover includes decision procedures for linear arithmetic, propositional logic, and temporal
	  logic, and users can conservatively extend its deductive capabilities through custom proof
	  strategies. NASALib is a comprehensive library of fundamental mathematics developed in PVS, along
	  with utilities for proving and animating specifications. These lectures focus on the development and
	  verification of algorithms through examples inspired by actual NASA verification projects. The
	  lectures provide a gentle introduction to advanced PVS features including proving techniques such as
	  induction-less induction, modeling with deep and shallow embeddings, and differential testing via
	  model animation.

	    Privacy-Preserving Reasoning

	    Prof. Ruzica Piskac (Yale University)
	  </span><br/>
	  <b>Abstract</b>: Formal methods offer a vast collection of techniques to analyze and ensure the correctness
	  of software and hardware systems against a given specification. In fact, modern formal methods tools
	  scale to industrial applications. Despite this significant success, privacy requirements are not
	  considered in the design of these tools. For example, when using automated reasoning tools, the
	  implicit requirement is that the formula to be proved is public. This raises an issue if the formula
	  itself reveals information that is supposed to remain private to one party. To overcome this issue,
	  we propose the concept of privacy-preserving automated reasoning.

	  In these lectures students will learn how to incorporate cryptographic primitives into automated
	  reasoning. We will present privacy-preserving Boolean satisfiability solver, which allows mutually
	  distrustful parties to evaluate the conjunction of their input formulas while maintaining
	  privacy. Additionally, we will also show how to prove the unsatisfiability of formulas by using
	  zero-knowledge protocols. We will discuss how the full formal verification workflow can be applied
	  in privacy-preserving settings.

	    Verifying Rust code with Verus
	  </span><br/>
	  <span class="lecturer">
	    Dr. Chris Hawblitzel (Microsoft Research)
	  </span><br/>
	  <b>Abstract</b>: <p>The Rust programming language is rapidly gaining acceptance as a modern, type-safe
	    alternative to C and C++ for low-level systems programming.  Rust includes an advanced type system,
	    similar to languages like Haskell and ML, that makes formal reasoning more elegant and natural.
	    Most importantly, Rust implements a novel ownership checker that manages aliasing and mutation,
	    allowing safe manual deallocation of unaliased values and prohibiting mutation of aliased values.
	    This ownership methodology is ideal for formal verification: it allows a verifier to reason about
	    values rather than mutable heap locations, making verification of Rust code similar to verification
	    of purely functional high-level languages.</p>

	  <p>This course will introduce Verus, a verifier for Rust code.  With Verus, programmers express proofs
	    and specifications using the Rust language, allowing proofs to take advantage of Rust's type
	    checking and ownership checking.  The course will describe how to write such specifications and
	    proofs and how the Verus tool translates these specifications and proofs into formulas that can be
	    efficiently checked by an SMT solver.  It will describe how to write proofs that take advantage of
	    Rust's ownership to express separation and permissions in a style similar to separation logic, and
	    how to use this style to verify safe Rust code, unsafe Rust code, and concurrent Rust code.</p>

	  <p>The course will include both lectures and hands-on exercises.  Students can install Verus on any
	    Linux, MacOS, or Windows laptop to edit and verify Rust code during the course.  No knowledge of
	    Rust is required beforehand.</p>

	    <b>Abstract</b>: Formal logic has become the lingua franca of
	    computing. It is used for specifying digital systems, annotating
	    programs with assertions, defining the semantics of programming
	    languages, and proving or refuting claims about software or hardware
	    systems. Familiarity with the language and methods of logic is a
	    foundation for research into formal aspects of computing. This course
	    covers the basics of logic focusing on the use of logic as a medium for
	    formalization and proof.

      <!-- Registration for in-person participation with SSFT25 is now closed.<br/>
	   Applicants are welcome to register for virtual participation. -->
      
      <hr width="80%">
      <p> The 2026 Summer School on Formal Techniques will take place in a hybrid mode: the lectures and labs
	will be live-streamed and recorded. We strongly encourage in-person participation so that you can
	benefit from interactions outside the classroom. We have funding from NSF to cover
	transportation/food/lodging expenses for selected US-based students. Non-student and non-US
	in-person participants are expected to cover their own transportation and will be charged a fee
	(around $150/day) to cover the cost of food and lodging.</p>
      <p> Applicants are urged to submit their applications as early as possible (no later than March 31,
	2026), since there are only a limited number of spaces available.  Those needing invitation letters
	for visa purposes should complete their applications as early as possible.  We strongly encourage
	the participation of women and under-represented minorities in the summer school.  The Summer School
	follows the Title IX Sexual Misconduct & Sexual Harassment Policy & Procedures spelled out at 
	https://menlo.edu/title-ix/.</p>

      <!-- 	minorities in the summer school.</p> -->

      <!-- We expect to provide support for the travel and accommodation for (a
	   limited number of) students registered at US universities. We
	   welcome applications from non-US students as well as non-students
	   (if space permits).  Non-US students will have to cover their own
	   travel; the cost (which covers meals and lodging) is:
	   <ul>
	     <li>US$800 for the summer school (SSFT21)</li>
	     <li>US$700 for the boot camp (FMiTF)</li>
	   </ul> -->
	   <!-- Although the summer school is virtual and there is no registration
		fee, attendance is restricted to registered participants.  Attendees
		who complete the summer school will receive a certificate by mail.
		Applications should be submitted together with names of
		two references (preferably advisors, professors, or senior
		colleagues) using the form below.   -->
	   <!-- </p>
		<p>
		  Applicants are urged to submit their applications before April 30,
