	Techniques based on formal logic, such as model checking,
	satisfiability, static analysis, and automated theorem proving, are
	finding a broad range of applications in modeling, analysis,
	verification, and synthesis. This school, the fourteenth in the
	series, will focus on the principles and practice of formal
	techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and
	development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate
	students and young researchers who are interested in studying and
	using formal techniques in their research.  A prior background in
	formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the
	school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with
	the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during laboratory
	sessions.  The main lectures will run from Monday May 26 to Friday
	May 30. They will be preceded by a background course "Speaking
	Logic" taught by Natarajan Shankar and St&eacute;phane
	Graham-Lengrand (SRI CSL) on May 24/25.
	<!-- The summer school will be
	     immediately followed by a two-day Bootcamp to reinforce some of the
	     skills acquired during the school.  Participants in the Bootcamp
	     will employ formal tools and techniques (including those taught in
	     this and prior summer school editions) under the supervision of the
	     Bootcamp faculty to create verified artifacts. -->

	  <b>Abstract</b>: Probabilistic programs encode randomized algorithms, robot controllers,
	  learning components, security mechanisms, and much more. They are 
	  however hard to grasp. Not only by humans, also by computers: checking 
	  elementary properties related to e.g., termination are "more 
	  undecidable" than for ordinary programs. The analysis of probabilistic 
	  programs requires manipulating irrational or even transcendental numbers.
	  <p>
	    Although this all sounds like a no-go for (semi-)automated analysis, I 
	    will present a deductive verification technique to analyse probabilistic 
	    programs. In contrast to simulation (like MCMC), this analysis yields 
	    exact results. Our technique is based on weakest precondition reasoning. 
	    We will explain the foundations of this approach, present some proof 
	    rules to reason about probabilistic while-loops, and discuss how the 
	    analysis can be automated---either fully or with the help of invariants.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Hands-on experiments will be carried out using the deductive verifier 
	    Caesar, see <a href="https://www.caesarverifier.org">"https://www.caesarverifier.org</a>.

	  <b>Abstract</b>: Satisfiability checking is a research area
	  devoted to the development and implementation of algorithms that
	  allow to check the satisfiability of logical formulas.
	  <p>
	    For propositional logic formulas, which are Boolean combinations
	    of Boolean variables, we could enumerate and check all possible
	    variable assignments. However, due to its bad average complexity,
	    this exploration approach is not applicable in
	    practice. Alternatively, the proof system of Boolean resolution
	    can be applied, but the applicability of this method is also
	    restricted to rather small problems. In the 90s, an elegant
	    combination of these two methods has been suggested, where the
	    proof construction is guided by an exploration of the assignment
	    space equipped with a smart look-ahead mechanism. This idea
	    allowed to develop impressively powerful SAT solvers, which are
	    able to effectively solve huge problems at industrial scale.</p>
	  <p>
	    The effectivity of SAT solvers gave motivation to extend to scope
	    of solver technologies to formulas of quantifier-free first-order
	    logic over different theories. On the one hand, eager SMT solving
	    approaches have been proposed for certain theories to transform
	    their formulas to propositional logic and use SAT solving to check
	    the result for satisfiability. On the other hand, (full/less) lazy
	    SMT solving uses SAT solving to explore the Boolean structure of
	    the formula, and employs theory solvers to check the consistency
	    of Boolean assignments in the theory domains. SMT solvers can be
	    used as general-purpose off-the-shelf tools. Due to their
	    impressive efficiency, they are nowadays frequently used in a wide
	    variety of applications.  A typical application encodes real-world
	    problems as logical formulas, whose solutions can be decoded to
	    solutions of the real-world problem.</p>
	  Recently, the idea of symbiotic combination of exploration and
	  proof construction has been also generalized to theories, most
	  notably quantifier-free real algebra, in the framework of the
	  model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT). In this
	  approach, exploration-guided proof construction is designed to run
	  both in the Boolean space and in the theory domain, simultaneously
	  in a consistent manner.
	  <p>
	    In this unit we give an introduction to the above mechanisms of
	    SAT and SMT solving, discuss some interesting ideas behind recent
	    developments, and illustrate the usage of SMT solvers on some
	    application examples.
	  </p>

	  <b>Abstract</b>:
	  R2U2, the Realizable Responsive Unobtrusive Unit was designed to fill a 
	  gap in real-world, and flight-certifiable, runtime verification. It 
	  enables realizable verification of an easy, expressive specification 
	  language based on Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL), with a 
	  generic interface that is highly adaptable to a wide range of missions 
	  and platforms. System designers can configure R2U2 once, then change the 
	  properties under test while the system, and R2U2, are running, without 
	  reconfiguration or re-upload, a critical feature for many aerospace 
	  applications. R2U2 is real-time responsive, continuously monitoring the 
	  system and detecting anomalies in real-time, or even ahead of real time 
	  with minimal estimation, to enable effective mitigation or rescue 
	  measures. It is also uniquely unobtrusive, designed not to change system 
	  behavior, certifiabiity, timing, tolerances, cost, or other mission 
	  parameters.
	  <p>
	    Today R2U2 is the only space-flight-certified runtime verification 
	    engine, and it has launched into space on several missions, including 
	    NASA's Lunar Gateway, Robonaut2 on the International Space Station, and 
	    a JAXA satellite. Lectures will feature the algorithms and architecture 
	    of the tool, while highlighting successful applications. There are 
	    multiple implementations of R2U2, and it is highly configurable to the 
	    specific needs of the mission under analysis; we will survey the options 
	    for specialization and analysis. Labs will offer an opportunity to 
	    configure and run R2U2 on realistic case studies, utilizing the 
	    human-facing C2PO interface.

	  <b>Materials</b>: R2U2 is open-source software, available for download from its website (<a href="https://r2u2.temporallogic.org/">https://r2u2.temporallogic.org/</a>). There are currently three implementations of R2U2 (hardware/VHDL, C, and embedded Rust); we will use the embedded Rust version. There are several support tools for better specification elicitation, validation, and debugging of R2U2's primary specification logic Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL); we will use the WEST GUI (tool download: <a href="https://github.com/zwang271/WEST">https://github.com/zwang271/WEST</a> website: https://west.temporallogic.org). In addition to directly interfacing with R2U2 to configure runtime verification, we will utilize the new R2U2 Playground (<a href="https://r2u2.temporallogic.org/playground/">https://r2u2.temporallogic.org/playground/</a>), an interactive web-based playground that provides visualization of R2U2 monitors. The R2U2 Playground provides stepwise execution coupled with reactive timeline plotting and visualization of its internal abstract syntax tree architecture.

	    Compositional Verification using the Gillian Platform
	  </span><br/>
	  <span class="lecturer">
	    Philippa Gardner (Imperial)
	  </span><br/>
	  <b>Abstract</b>: One of the main challenges that modern program
	  analysis tools must face is scalability, that is, the ability to
	  tractably analyse large, dynamically changing codebases. Such
	  scalability requires techniques and tools that are functionally
	  compositional (or simply compositional) where the analysis works
	  on functions in isolation, at any point in the codebase, and then
	  records the results in simple function specifications that can be
	  used in broader calling contexts. However, the traditional tools
	  based on first-order logic can only be compositional for functions
	  that manipulate the variable store, but not for functions that
	  manipulate the heap, limiting their usability.
	  <p>
	    A key insight is that, to obtain compositionality, the analysis
	    should work with function specifications that are local, in that
	    they should describe the function behaviour only on the partial
	    states or resources that the function accesses or manipulates, and
	    a mechanism for using such specifications when the function is
	    called by code working on a larger state. This insight was first
	    introduced in separation logic (SL, [1]), a modern
	    over-approximating (OX) program logic for compositional
	    verification of correctness properties, which features local
	    function specifications that can be called on larger state with
	    the help of the frame rule. Recently, these ideas have been
	    adapted to under-approximate (UX) reasoning in the context of
	    incorrectness separation logic (ISL, [3,2]) for compositional true
	    bug-finding.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Ideas from SL and ISL have led to the development of efficient
	    compositional symbolic execution tools and platforms in academia
	    and industry, such as VeriFast, Viper and CN for semi-automatic OX
	    verification based on SL, Meta’s Infer-Pulse for automatic UX true
	    bug-finding based on ISL, and Gillian for both. Gillian [5,6,7,8]
	    is unique in that it is parametric on the memory model of the
	    language and its compositional symbolic execution engine is
	    underpinned by strong mathematical foundations [4]. It has been
	    instantiated to the C, JavaScript and Rust languages, and applied
	    to industrial code.
	  </p>
	  <b>Course Outline</b>:
	  This course will provide a whirl-wind tour of separation logic,
	  compositional symbolic execution and Gillian. It is adapted from
	  my MSc course on “Scalable Verified Software: Separation Logic”
	  that I have been teaching at Imperial for many years.
	  <p>
	    The lectures will comprise:
	    <ul>
	      <li> An introduction to SL and ISL for reasoning about mutable
		data structures. You will learn how to write program
		specifications and prove properties of programs, both informally
		using sketch proofs and formally using rigorous proofs.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		An introduction to compositional symbolic execution which creates
		and uses function specifications from underlying separation logics
		such as SL and ISL, and provides a sound theoretical foundation
		for, and indeed was partially inspired by, the Gillian platform.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The labs will concentrate on compositional OX verification based
	    on SL, and will give you hands-on experience of using Gillian. For
	    the last three years, we have had experience holding a lab on
	    Gillian as part of my MSc course, made possible due to the
	    addition of a symbolic debugger for Gillian. The labs will
	    comprise:
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		Experience with using the WiSL tool, a Gillian instantiation
		to a small while language with a simple block-offset memory
		model, exploring many exercises to transition from the
		informal proof sketches introduced in the lectures to the
		semi-automatic Gillian proofs that sometimes require the
		insertion of tactics.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Experience with using the Gillian-C tool, working with more
		complex examples from the lectures and (hopefully, it’s a little
		ambitious) the real-world Collections-C library.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    Before the Course Please install Gillian on your laptops before
	    the course starts; installation instructions for Gillian can be

	    <b>Abstract</b>: Formal logic has become the lingua franca of
	    computing. It is used for specifying digital systems, annotating
	    programs with assertions, defining the semantics of programming
	    languages, and proving or refuting claims about software or hardware
	    systems. Familiarity with the language and methods of logic is a
	    foundation for research into formal aspects of computing. This course
	    covers the basics of logic focusing on the use of logic as a medium for
	    formalization and proof.

	  <b>Abstract</b>: The success of large language models is striking, especially given that the training data consists of raw, unstructured text. In this talk, we will propose that category theory can provide a natural framework for investigating this passage from texts, and probability distributions on them, to a more semantically meaningful space. Equipped with motivation from an analogy between linear algebra and category theory, we will define a category of expressions in language enriched over the unit interval and afterwards pass to enriched copresheaves on that category. We will see that the latter setting has rich mathematical structure and comes with ready-made tools in which to explore that structure.

      <p>
	This year, the school/bootcamp will take place in a hybrid mode:
	the lectures and labs will be live-streamed and recorded. We
	strongly encourage in-person participation so that you can benefit
	from interactions outside the classroom. We have funding from NSF
	to cover transportation/food/lodging expenses for selected
	US-based students. Non-student and non-US in-person participants
	are expected to cover their own transportation and will be charged
	a fee (around $150/day) to cover the cost of food and lodging.</p>
      <p>
	The 2025 Summer School on Formal Techniques will be presented in a
	hybrid format. We encourage those students who can attend in
	person to do so. Those who cannot be there in person can still
	participate virtually but they will need to synchronize with the
	Pacific Daylight Savings Time. Applications should be submitted
	together with names of two references (preferably advisors,
	professors, or senior colleagues).</p>
      <p>
	Applicants are urged to submit their applications before March 31,
	2025, since there are only a limited number of spaces available.
	Those needing invitation letters for visa purposes are encouraged
	to complete their applications as early as possible.  We strongly
	encourage the participation of women and under-represented
	minorities in the summer school.</p>
      <p>
	The nearest airport to the summer school is SFO. Use Supershuttle
	for ground transportation to/from SFO - we should have a discount
	code shortly.</p>

      <!-- We expect to provide support for the travel and accommodation for (a
	   limited number of) students registered at US universities. We
	   welcome applications from non-US students as well as non-students
	   (if space permits).  Non-US students will have to cover their own
	   travel; the cost (which covers meals and lodging) is:
	   <ul>
	     <li>US$800 for the summer school (SSFT21)</li>
	     <li>US$700 for the boot camp (FMiTF)</li>
	   </ul> -->
	   <!-- Although the summer school is virtual and there is no registration
		fee, attendance is restricted to registered participants.  Attendees
		who complete the summer school will receive a certificate by mail.
		Applications should be submitted together with names of
		two references (preferably advisors, professors, or senior
		colleagues) using the form below.   -->
	   <!-- </p>
		<p>
		  Applicants are urged to submit their applications before April 30,
		  2022, since there are only a limited number of spaces available.
		  Non-US applicants requiring US visas are requested to apply early.
		  We strongly encourage the participation of women and
